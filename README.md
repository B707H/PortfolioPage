# PortfolioPage

My personal portfolio page.
A basic, responsive HTML based website with some JS and jQuery.

The whole page was created in SublimeText (a sophisticated text editor for code), no WordPress/Joomla/Drupal/etc. was used!

Take a look at the live version here [b707h.com](https://www.b707h.com).
